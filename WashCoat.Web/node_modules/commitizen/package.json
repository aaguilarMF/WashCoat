No more waiting until later for a git commit hook to run and reject your commit (though [that](https://github.com/kentcdodds/validate-commit-msg) can still be helpful). No more digging through CONTRIBUTING.md to find what the preferred format is. Get instant feedback on your commit message formatting and be prompted for required fields.\n\n[![travis.ci](https://img.shields.io/travis/commitizen/cz-cli.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/commitizen/cz-cli) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ha5vb0p6iq8450un/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jimthedev/cz-cli/branch/master)\n [![codecov.io](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/commitizen/cz-cli.svg?style=flat-square)](https://codecov.io/github/commitizen/cz-cli?branch=master) [![npm monthly downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/commitizen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitizen) [![current version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/commitizen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitizen) [![bitHound Score](https://www.bithound.io/github/commitizen/cz-cli/badges/score.svg)](https://www.bithound.io/github/commitizen/cz-cli) [![semantic-release](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20%20%F0%9F%93%A6%F0%9F%9A%80-semantic--release-e10079.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)\n\n#### Installing the command line tool\nInstallation is as simple as running the following command (add sudo if on OSX/Linux):\n\n```\nnpm install -g commitizen\n```\n\n#### Using the command line tool\nNow, simply use `git cz` instead of `git commit` when committing.\n\nWhen you're working in a Commitizen friendly repository, you'll be prompted to fill in any required fields and your commit messages will be formatted according to the standards defined by project maintainers.\n\n[![Add and commit with Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli/raw/master/meta/screenshots/add-commit.png)](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli/raw/master/meta/screenshots/add-commit.png)\n\nIf you're not working in a Commitizen friendly repository, then `git cz` will work just the same as `git commit`.\n\n### Commitizen for project maintainers\nAs a project maintainer, making your repo Commitizen friendly allows you to select pre-existing commit message conventions or to create your own custom commit message convention. When a contributor to your repo uses Commitizen, they will be prompted for the correct fields at commit time.\n\n#### Making your repo Commitizen-friendly\n\nFor this example, we'll be setting up our repo to use [AngularJS's commit message convention](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-git-commit-guidelines) also known as [conventional-changelog](https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog).\n\nFirst, install the Commitizen cli tools:\n\n```\nnpm install commitizen -g\n```\n\nNext, initialize your project to use the cz-conventional-changelog adapter by typing:\n\n```\ncommitizen init cz-conventional-changelog --save-dev --save-exact\n```\n\nNote that if you want to force install over the top of an old adapter, you can apply the `--force` argument. For more information on this, just run `commitizen help`.\n\nThe above command does three things for you. It installs the cz-conventional-changelog adapter npm module, it saves it to the package.json's dependencies or devDependencies, and lastly it  add the `config.commitizen` key to the root of your **package.json** as shown here:\n\n```json\n...\n  \"config\": {\n    \"commitizen\": {\n      \"path\": \"cz-conventional-changelog\"\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nThis just tells Commitizen which adapter we actually want our contributors to use when they try to commit to this repo.\n\n`commitizen.path` is resolved via [require.resolve](https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#globals_require_resolve) and supports\n\n*  npm modules\n*  directories relative to `process.cwd()` containing an `index.js` file\n*  file base names relative to `process.cwd()` with `js` extension\n*  full relative file names\n*  absolute paths.\n\nPlease note that in previous version of Commitizen we used czConfig. **czConfig has been deprecated** and you should migrate to the new format before Commitizen 3.0.0.\n\n#### Congratulations your repo is Commitizen-friendly. Time to flaunt it!\n\nAdd the Commitizen-friendly badge to your README using the following markdown:\n```\n[![Commitizen friendly](https://img.shields.io/badge/commitizen-friendly-brightgreen.svg)](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/)\n```\n\nYour badge will look like this:\n\n[![Commitizen-friendly](https://img.shields.io/badge/commitizen-friendly-brightgreen.svg)](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/)\n\nIt may also make sense to change your README.md or CONTRIBUTING.md to include or link to the Commitizen project so that your new contributors may learn more about installing and using Commitizen.\n\n\n#### Go further\n\nCommitizen is great on its own, but it shines when you use it with some other amazing open source tools. Kent C. Dodds shows you how to accomplish this in his Egghead.io series, [How to write an open source javascript library](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-write-an-open-source-javascript-library). Many of the concepts can be applied to non-javascript projects as well.\n\n#### Retrying failed commits\n\nAs of version 2.7.1, you may attempt to retry the last commit using the `git cz --retry` command. This can be helpful when you have tests set up to run via a git precommit hook.  In this scenario, you may have attempted a Commitizen commit, painstakingly filled out all of the commitizen fields, but your tests fail. In previous Commitizen versions, after fixing your tests, you would be forced to fill out all of the fields again. Enter the retry command. Commitizen will retry the last commit that you attempted in this repo without you needing to fill out the fields again.\n\nPlease note that the retry cache may be cleared when upgrading commitizen versions, upgrading adapters, or if you delete the `commitizen.json` file in your home or temp directory.  Additionally, the commit cache uses the filesystem path of the repo, so if you move a repo or change its path, you will not be able to retry a commit. This is an edge case, but might be confusing if you have scenarios where you are moving folders that contain repos.\n\nIt is important to note that if you are running `git-cz` from a npm script (let's say it is called `commit`) you will need to do one of the following:\n- Pass `-- --retry` as an argument for your script. i.e: `npm run commit -- --retry`\n- Use [npm-run](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run) to find and call git-cz executable directly. i.e: `npm-run git-cz --retry`\n- Use [npm-quick-run](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-quick-run) i.e: `nr commit --retry` or just `nr c --retry` (which will run all scripts that starts with the letter 'c')\n\nNote that the last two options **do not** require you to pass `--` before the args but the first **does**.\n\n### Commitizen for multi-repo proejcts\n\nAs a project maintainer of many projects, you may want to standardize on a single commit message\nformat for all of them. You can create your own node module which acts as front-end for commitizen.\n\n#### 1. Create your own entry point script\n\n\n```\n// my-cli.js\n\n#!/usr/bin/env node\n\"use strict\";\n\nconst path = require('path');\nconst bootstrap = require('commitizen/dist/cli/git-cz').bootstrap;\n\nbootstrap({\n  cliPath: path.join(__dirname, '../node_modules/commitizen'),\n  // this is new\n  config: {\n    \"path\": \"cz-conventional-changelog\"\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### 2. Add script to package.json\n\n```\n// package.json\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"company-commit\",\n  \"bin\": \"./my-cli.js\"\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"commitizen\": \"^2.7.6\",\n    \"cz-conventional-changelog\": \"^1.1.5\",\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Publish it to npm and use it!\n\n```\nnpm install company-commit --save-dev\n./node_modules/.bin/company-commit\n```\n\n### Adapters\n\nWe know that every project and build process has different requirements so we've tried to keep Commitizen open for extension. You can do this by choosing from any of the pre-build adapters or even by building your own. Here are some of the great adapters available to you:\n\n- [cz-conventional-changelog](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cz-conventional-changelog)\n- [cz-jira-smart-commit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cz-jira-smart-commit)\n- [rb-conventional-changelog](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rb-conventional-changelog)\n- [cz-mapbox-changelog](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cz-mapbox-changelog)\n\nTo create an adapter, just fork one of these great adapters and modify it to suit your needs.  We pass you an instance of [Inquirer.js](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/) but you can capture input using whatever means necessary. Just call the `commit` callback with a string and we'll be happy. Publish it to npm, and you'll be all set!\n\n### Philosophy\n\n#### About Commitizen\nCommitizen is an open source project that helps contributors be good open source citizens. It accomplishes this by prompting them to follow commit message conventions at commit time. It also empowers project maintainers to create or use predefined commit message conventions in their repos to better communicate their expectations to potential contributors.\n\n#### Commitizen or Commit Hooks\nBoth! Commitizen is not meant to be a replacement for git commit hooks. Rather, it is meant to work side-by-side with them to ensure a consistent and positive experience for your contributors. Commitizen treats the commit command as a declarative action. The contributor is declaring that they wish to contribute to your project. It is up to you as the maintainer to define what rules they should be following.\n\nWe accomplish this by letting you define which adapter you'd like to use in your project. Adapters just allow multiple projects to share the same commit message conventions. A good example of an adapter is the cz-conventional-changlog adapter.\n\n### Authors and Contributors\n@JimTheDev (Jim Cummins, author)\n@kentcdodds\n@accraze\n@kytwb\n@Den-dp\n\nSpecial thanks to @stevelacy, whose [gulp-git](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-git) project makes commitizen possible.\n",
